# Gelpack
This python package contains functions to interact with the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project data. 

## Cohorts
The Cohort class takes in a dictionary with icd-10, hpo or disease terms and gathers a list of participants and their age, mortality, ancestry, and sex.

## GEL survival analysis
The Survdat class contains functions to extract diagnosis dates, date of death and last follow ups with the clinic to calculate and plot a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (stratifying on Domain variants).

## Data sources and approach:
### This package requires a set up .netrc to link with LabKey.

### Cohort building:
input a dictionary with keys of: icd-10 codes, hpo terms, cancer terms, disease terms.

Sources:
* ICD-10:
- hes-apc
- hes-ae
- hes-op
- mortality
- mhsds_medical_history_previous_diagnosis
- mhsds_provisional_diagnosis
- mhsds_primary_diagnosis
- mhsds_secondary_diagnosis
- mhsds_care_activity
- mhsds_indirect_activity
- cancer_invest_sample_pathology
- cancer_participant_tumour
- cancer_registry
- rtds
- sact
- av_tumour

* HPO terms
- rare_diseases_participant_phenotype

* cancer terms
- cancer_participant_disease

* disease terms
- rare_diseases_participant_disease


### Survival
Cancer participants:
* PRIMARY cancers in cancer_analysis
* keeping unique participant_ids + disease_types.

Date of death:
* Earliest date between death_details and mortality tables

Date of diagnosis:
* Sources:
- cancer_participant_tumour
- av_tumour
- cancer_registry
* Approach:
- Translate ICD-10 code to a gel_disease_type
- Sort tables by date and keep only the first diagnosis date for each disease type.
- merge sources and keep unique values per participant.
- merge dod with cancer_analysis matching both the participant_id and disease_types

* inferring missing date of diagnosis from averages only occurs if the --infer flag is True.

Date of last follow up:
- the last known interaction within HES data.
